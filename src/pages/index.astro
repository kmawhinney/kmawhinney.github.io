              With a background in software engineering, product management, and entrepreneurship, I'm passionate about all things technology. My unique skillset is being able to <b>bridge the gap between vision, strategy, and execution</b>, outlined below in the section:

              My greatest strength is my ability to learn anything I put my mind to. As a business undergrad, I <b>taught myself to code from scratch</b>, going from self-taught to working at the biggest tech companies like Meta, AWS, and Microsoft, in just a few years. I love to learn, and whatever I don't know, I'm confident I can figure out.

              Outside my professional pursuits, I have a wide assortment of things I'm passionate about. I love spending time with family & friends, playing anything competitive (sports, board games, video games), watching movies, creating video content, and more!

              I also love fitness and traveling, both of which are documented on this website - feel free to check them out!

              These stages make up the loop of taking an idea and turning it into a success.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Every organization, whether a startup or a Fortune 500 company, moves through these stages. While there are many skilled people who excel in one stage, a major challenge that exists is bridging the gaps between them.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              That's why my goal has always been to "close the loop" by being capable across this entire cycle, connecting vision, strategy, and execution to drive success.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my experience in entrepreneurship, product leadership, and software engineering, I've developed a skill set across all three stages, making me capable of bridging the gaps between them. <b>I'm able to work as a product-minded engineer, a technically-proficient product manager, and anything in between.</b>
